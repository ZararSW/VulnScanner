Title: Advanced Web Vulnerability Scanner with Bug Bounty Methodology
Functionality:
Design and develop an advanced, automated vulnerability scanner tailored to emulate a bug bounty hunter's methodology. The scanner should aggressively and comprehensively test web applications and services for security flaws, mimicking the depth and creativity of manual ethical hacking processes.

Target Audience:
Cybersecurity professionals

Bug bounty hunters

Penetration testers

DevSecOps teams

Security researchers

Core Features and Capabilities:
1. Comprehensive Reconnaissance
Use OSINT techniques to gather subdomains, IPs, endpoints, and associated services.

Integrate tools like Amass, Subfinder, and Assetfinder.

Passive and active reconnaissance modes.

2. Intelligent Crawling and Discovery
Smart spidering that understands JavaScript-rendered content.

API endpoint discovery and parameter fuzzing.

3. Automated Vulnerability Testing
Scan for OWASP Top 10 (e.g., XSS, SQLi, CSRF, IDOR).

Test for SSRF, RCE, LFI/RFI, and template injection.

Include logic flaws and misconfigurations (e.g., open S3 buckets, exposed .git directories).

4. Bug Bounty-Inspired Heuristics
Incorporate patterns and payloads commonly used in bug bounty programs.

Adaptive testing based on response behavior (e.g., time-based inference).

Use fuzzing, wordlists, and brute-forcing adapted from top bounty findings.

5. Tool Integration & Extensibility
Modular plugin system for integrating tools like:

Burp Suite APIs

Nuclei for templated scanning

FFUF, Wfuzz for directory and parameter brute-force

SQLMap for advanced SQLi exploitation

Compatibility with bug bounty platforms like HackerOne or Bugcrowd APIs.

6. Stealth & Evasion Techniques
Throttling, random user agents, IP rotation (Tor/proxy support), header spoofing.

7. Reporting & Logging
Export results in various formats (HTML, JSON, PDF, Burp-compatible).

Include PoC (proof-of-concept) for exploitable findings.

Risk rating based on CVSS scores and custom prioritization logic.

8. Continuous Updates
Auto-update module for CVEs, payloads, and scan templates.

Community-contributed modules and detection patterns.

Design Considerations:
CLI-first tool with optional web UI for visualization.

Written in Go or Python for speed and extensibility.

Support for containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).

Scalable architecture with options for cloud scanning (via AWS, GCP).

Development Roadmap:
Phase 1 – Core Framework: Scanner engine, basic recon & scanning modules.

Phase 2 – Bug Bounty Emulation: Advanced logic flaws, automation, and payload logic.

Phase 3 – UI & UX: Command-line usability enhancements, optional web dashboard.

Phase 4 – Intelligence & Updates: Integration of threat intelligence and live update system.

Phase 5 – Community & Extensibility: Plugin system and contributor support.
